# Risk_the_game
My own digital version of Hasbro's board game - Risk

GAME IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT ENGLISH LANGUAGE WILL BE ADD SOON.
GAME IS TESTED ON LINUX - UBUNTU 18.04, OTHETR OS SUPPORT SOON.

The idea of this game (at this point) is to play it using this program and Hasbro's Risk game board at the same time. Board will help you and four friends visualize your moves and owned territores.

Recommend to:
PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS! 

Implemeted feautures:
- adding players and setting them names,
- choosing own version (size) of map, or play on whole world,
- choosing start territory,
- rounds when players can recruit, move/attack, or wait,
- recruit system, depending on playeer's level,
- move and attack system which allows to attack from many territories at the same time,
- simple battle mechanics
- player level depending on player's owned territores
